# Fugalist 

Fugalist is an independent[^disclaimer] web site for finding, building, and sharing Dorico expression maps.

If you have a sample library you want to use with Dorico, some heroic person may already have built and
[shared](https://fugalist.com/Search) an expression map for it.
If so, you can just download the expression map and import it into Dorico.

If you don't find what you want, Fugalist has a tool to help you create your own expression map.
After you have built something you like, you can share it (and be a hero!).
