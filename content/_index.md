If you have a VST sample library you want to use with Dorico, some heroic person may already have built and
[shared](https://fugalist.com/Search) an expression map for it.
You can just download the expression map and import it into Dorico.

If you don't find what you want, Fugalist has a tool to help you create your own expression map.
After you have built something you like, you can share it and be a hero yourself.
