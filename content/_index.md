[Dorico](https://new.steinberg.net/dorico/) uses _expression maps_ to control how it plays the articulations, 
dynamics, and playing techniques you use in your musical score.
An expression map is essentially a translation between musical notation and [MIDI](https://www.midi.org/) events used to control a
[VST](https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/technologies/vst3.html) instrument.

Fugalist is an independent website for finding, building, and sharing expression maps.

Fugalist is not affiliated with Steinberg or Dorico.

If you have a VST sample library you want to use with Dorico, some heroic person may already have built and
[shared](https://fugalist.com/Search) an expression map for it.
You can just download the expression map and import it into Dorico.

If you don't find what you want, Fugalist has a tool to help you create your own expression map.
After you have built something you like, you can share it and be a hero yourself.
