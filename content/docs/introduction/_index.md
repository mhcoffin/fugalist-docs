# Introduction

Here's my definition of _expression map_:

> _An expression map takes in the information that can be gleaned about a note from a musical score---pitch, duration,
relative volume, playing techniques, etc.---and produces MIDI signals to play the note more or less as
human would play it, but on a [VST instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology)._

If that statement doesn't leave any questions in your mind, don't waste your time here:
skip ahead to the [next section](/docs/tool). 
Otherwise, [continue](/docs/introduction/notation/#music-notation).
