# Getting Started

## Lurking

If you just want to lurk, you don't need an account.
You can read the forum or download shared expression maps. 

## Accounts

If you decide you want to post on the forum or create expression maps, you need an account.
Accounts are free, and we won't share your data with anyone.

Fugalist is a hobby, not a business, but 
we may, at some point in the future, decide to run ads on Fugalist to offset hosting costs.

### No Password

Fugalist uses no-password sign-in system. 
Just enter your email address on the sign-in page and Fugalist will send a sign-in link.
Click the link and you should be signed in.
(If you don't seem to get mail, please check your spam folder.)
You should remain signed in on that device until you explicitly sign out. 

If you accidentally get signed out, or if you want to use the same account on a different device, 
just ask for another sign-in link with the same email.

{{< hint info >}}
Fugalist won't use your email for any purpose other than sending sign-in links. We won't reveal or sell your
email address.
