# Getting Started

## Lurking

If you just want to lurk, you don't need an account.

You can read the forum, browse around for shared expression maps, and download shared expression maps. 

## Accounts

If you decide you want to post on the forum or create expression maps, then you need an account.
Accounts are free.

Fugalist is a hobby, not a business.
We may, at some point in the future, decide to run ads on Fugalist to offset hosting costs.

Fugalist uses a no-password sign-in. Enter your email address; Fugalist will send a sign-in link. Click the 
link and you should be signed in.
You should remain signed on that device until you explicitly sign out. 
If you accidentally get signed out, or if you want to use the same account on a different device, 
just ask for another sign-in link.

{{< hint info >}}
Fugalist won't use your email for any other purpose than sending sign-in links. We won't reveal or sell your
email address.
