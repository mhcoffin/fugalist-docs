# The Options Tab

{{< hint info >}}
Dorico's defaults work pretty well most of the time. My advice is to ignore this tab initially. 
Come back to it when you have a specific reason.
{{< /hint >}}


Use the Options tab to control playback options overrides. E.g., you can specify the playback duration Dorico 
will use for default notes, tenuto notes, etc. you can also control the way Dorico applies additional emphasis
to the first note in a bar; how much extra emphasis Dorico gives to accented notes, etc. 

All the options apply across all articulations in the expression map.
