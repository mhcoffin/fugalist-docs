# The Overview Tab

Use the overview tab to specify metadata about the expression map: who created it, what's it for, etc.

Some fields from this tab are put into the generated Dorico expression map. 
Other fields are not part of the expression map itself, but are used to help others find your expression
map if you choose to share it. 

This tab is also the place to go to download or share your expression map.

Here's an example of an overview:
