## The Overview Tab

The overview tab is where you enter metadata about the expression map: who created it, what's it for, etc.
Some of the fields from this tab are put into the expression map itself. These will show up in 
Dorico if view the expression map there.

Other fields are not part of the expression map itself, but are used to help others find your expression
map if you choose to share it.

Here's an example:

![Example](/overview-tab.png)

## Fields

### Project ID.

A unique identifier for this project, generated by Fugalist. 

### Created

The time the project was created.

### Current version 

Fugalist automatically tracks versions when you share your expression map. If you have never shared, the version
will be 1. When (if) you share the first time, version 1 is shared, and the version is immediately incremented to 2. 
Further modifications you make don't change what has been shared until you explicitly share again.

### Last modified

The last time you changed anything in this expression map.

### Last shared

The last time you shared this expression map.

### Name

Your name for this expression map. This is the name included in the generated Dorico expression map. Changing
the name does not change the Project ID. 

### Description

Your description of the expression map. 
This will be included in the generated Dorico expression map. It is also available to others if you 
share the expression map. 

### Plugins

What plugins this expression map is for. As with the description, this is included in the generated Dorico expression 
map, and is visible to others if you share. 

Best practice: use the exact name of the library preset if one exists. That way there's no ambiguity about what
the expression is for.

### Vendor

The vendor of the sample library. This is not included in the generated expression map. If you share, it's visible
to people looking for an expression map. 

### Instruments

The instrument or instruments this expression map applies to: guitar, violin, etc.  This is not included in the 
generated expression map. If you share, it's visible to people looking for an expression map.

### Other search tags

To make it easier for other people to find shared expression maps, you can include other relevant search terms here.

### Demos

You can upload demos of your expression map in action. Useful for people looking for an expression map. 

### Action Buttons

#### Download

This button downloads the latest version of the generated Dorico expression map to your local machine. 
If you've made changes since the last download, it regenerates the map. If not, you get the same one as last time.

#### Copy URL to clipboard

This button copies the URL of the latest version of the generated Dorico expression map. If you've made changes since
the last download, it regenerates the map. The URL remains the same for any single version of the expression map. The 
URL changes when the version changes. 

The URL is very difficult to guess, but it's **not** private. That means that if you give the URL to a friend, they can
download the expression map. They can also give it away to others or publish it. 
However, they only have read access. They won't be able to edit your expression map in any way.

#### Share

This button shares current state of your expression map and then increments the version. 
The shared expression map will show up in the Fugalist search page, so anyone can find it and download it. 

To share, you must have filled in a name, description, vendor, and instruments. 

Even after you share, the previous shared version is still there, with the old URL.[^old]

[^old]: Currently Fugalist doesn't provide a direct way to get the URL of old versions of shared expression maps. 
That might be added later if people find a use for it.

#### Un-share

If you have shared a version and suddenly realize that you've made a horrible mistake that you don't want anyone to see,
you can un-share. 
This doesn't actually delete anything, but it fixes things so that people browsing for maps won't see your expression
map until you share again (with a new version and URL).
