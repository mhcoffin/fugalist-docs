# Work flow

A few hints about work flow. 

## Saving your work

Your work is saved right away. As soon as you fill in a field, it's stored (in the cloud).
The downside of this is that you need an internet connection to use Fugalist. You can stop
working on a project and come back to it later---even on another device---and pick up where you left off. 

## Tab Flipping

You definitely don't have to work your way left-to-right through the project tabs. 
Flipping back and forth works fine: add a few VST sounds, assign them, download an expression map to try it out.
Add more VST sounds, assign them, download again and try that out.
Repeat until the air vibrates in interesting ways.

## Sound Assignment Strategies

One way to do sound assignment is to pick the most common sound---probably a sustain---and start by assigning
it to all combinations in the table.
Then override specific exceptions, by toggling technique filters or by surgically changing particular rows.

Another way is to try to assign sounds correctly the first time. If you do this,
toggling the _Defined_ filter to **off** is really handy. 
With this filter off, you never accidentally override previous work.

## Undo

Unfortunately, Fugalist doesn't have _undo_. At least not yet. Sorry.
