# The Composite Sounds Tab

The composite sounds tab provides support for
- note-length conditions,
- length adjustments, and
- octave transpositions.

A composite sound can have multiple branches that depend on note-length conditions.
Here is an example:

![Example](/composite-tab.png)

If you assign this composite sound (**Sustain**) to some combination of playing techniques then,
when Dorico plays a note with those techniques, it will decide whether to use
a **staccato** sound or a **sustain** based the duration of the note.

When you create a composite sound (by clicking **+**) a single branch is created. You can add other branches to
the composite sound by clicking **+** on the right.
