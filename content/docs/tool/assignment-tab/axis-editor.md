# Axis Editor

Clicking on the name of the column opens a dialog that lets you edit that group of playing techniques:

![Axis](/axis-editor.png)

Here you can
- change the name of the axis
- add or delete playing techniques from the axis
- move the axis left or right if that makes more sense to you
- add a new axis
- delete an axis.

Fugalist provides a default set of axes to get started. 
At minimum, for any particular instrument, you will probably want to add to the **Techniques** axis playing techniques specific to that instrument.
