# Playing Technique Filters

The column header of the **Length** axis looks like this:

![axis-header](/axis-header.png)

We saw [earlier](/docs/tool/assignment-tab/axis-editor) that clicking on the **Length** button opens the axis-editor dialog. 
Clicking on a playing technique such as
_staccato_ toggles the visibility of table rows containing that technique.
I.e., if you toggle _Staccato_ off, all the rows containing _Staccato_ will be hidden.
If you toggle it on, they become visible again.

You can toggle each playing technique individually. For example, if you toggle off everything except _Tenuto_
in the **Length** axis and everything except _Legato_ in the **Legato** axis, only rows that contain both
_Tenuto_ and _Legato_ will remain visible.

If you want to pick exactly one playing technique from an axis, you can double-click it. 
It will be toggled on, and all the others in that axis will be toggled off. 
The reset button toggles all the playing techniques to _on_.

Adjusting the playing technique filters is a convenient way to focus in on a particular set of rows.
For example, suppose your sample library has a "harsh staccato" staccato patch. 
You might want to use that patch for at least some combinations that contain
_Marcato_ along with either _Staccato_ or _Staccatissimo_.
Instead of scrolling around looking for applicable rows, with a few
clicks you can focus in on exactly the rows that have those playing techniques and then decide what to do.
